//Array:They are the compound data types.
//Array allows you to tell the compiler to give a collection of as many elements 
//as you want and give those element to a single name
//Properties:
//-Fixed size
//-Elements are  of same type.
//-Stored contiguosly in memory.(memory is allocated as one chunk)
//-Individual element can be accesed by their position or index.
//-First element is at index 0.
//-Programmers responsibility to handle "Out of bounds".

//Scenario:
//We use We use array to keep the data of students.
 / But the size of the array is fixed,so we have two option to consider.
 / 1---> Make the array so big that it will fit all records.
 / 2---> Use dynamic array such as Vector.
 *//
 
 // Vector:
 /*
  * It is a part of C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
  * Can grow and shrink at execution time.
  * Provides similar syntax and semantics as arrays.
  * It is very efficient.
  * Can provide bounds checking.
  * Also uses various cool features like sort,reverse,find and many more.
  */
  
  //Declaration and initializations.
  /*
   * Can be used after using #include<vector>
   * Can be defined by vector <int> marks(20)
   * 
   * */
